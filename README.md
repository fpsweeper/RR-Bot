__**Raiding Runs:**__
Raiding Run is a new concept of Raid2Earn, where bot admin can launch raiding contests, each raiding run will have a target point (a number of points once reached by the first user he'll automatically be selected as winner).
Using the raiding run bot, users can view the top 10 leaderboard in each RR and their rank with the target points. Each raiding run can have multiple raiding missions, each mission can have multiple points for comments, likes and retweets,
defined by the admin.
